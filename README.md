# Leap for Loaves

## What is this?

This is Leap for Loaves (http://www.leapforloaves.com), a project by space150. 

We decided that since we have an extra day this year, why not use it to do something good?

### Why:

In honor of Leap Year, we're raising money for charity by asking people to literally leap up and down. Help us reach our goal of 1,000 feet, and we'll donate $1,000 to the Second Harvest food bank.

### How:

The app uses your phone's accelerometer to find out how long your leap lasted. From that information we determine how high you went. It may not be scientific, but it is fun-and it's for a good cause, so who cares?

## Requirements

Leap for Loaves was built with Ruby on Rails 3.2.1 and uses Bundler for gem management. You will need the following on your system:

* Ruby 1.9.2 ([rvm](http://beginrescueend.com) is recommended)
* [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) 1.0
* PostgreSQL

After cloning the repository, simple run 

<code>bundle install</code>

and

<code>rake db:migrate</code>

to get everything up and running.
